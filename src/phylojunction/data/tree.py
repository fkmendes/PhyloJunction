class AnnotatedTree(dp.Tree):
    """Tree annotated with discrete states. 

    Parameters:
        tree (dendropy.Tree): Main class member, holding the full tree.
        tree_reconstructed (dendropy.Tree): Reconstructed tree
            produced by pruning the full tree from non-observed
            phylogenetic paths.
        origin_node (dendropy.Node): Origin node. It is 'None' if no
            origin node.
        root_node (dendropy.Node): Root node. It is 'None' if no root
            node.
        brosc_node (dendropy.Node): Node that occurs before the root
            node when tree starts from origin node. The brosc_node can
            be a terminal or internal node, and is replaced by the root
            node if a speciation event happens.
        with_origin (bool): Flag indicating that tree starts at origin
            node. Upon instantiation of class, defaults to 'False'. 
        tree_read_as_newick (bool): Flag indicating that tree was not
            simulated in PJ, but read as a Newick string instead.
            Upon instantiation of class, defaults to 'False'.
        condition_on_obs_both_sides_root (bool): Flag indicating if
            root node, when simulation starts from it (!), has at least
            one living on either side. If not specified by user upon
            instantiation of class, defaults to 'False'.
        tree_died (bool): Flag indicating if full tree went extinct
            before reaching the specified age stopping condition (i.e.,
            the reconstructed tree should be empty).
        tree_invalid (bool): Flag indicating (if tree was simulated)
            that rejection sampling deemed the tree invalid. If not
            specified upon class instantiation, tree is assumed to have
            been read as a string, and flag is assigned 'True'.
        seed_age (float): Age of seed node (either origin or root).
        max_age (float): Maximum age of the tree when it was simulated
            with an age stopping condition. If not provided by user
            upon class instantiation, it is 'None'.
        origin_age (float): Age of origin node, if there is one,
            otherwise 'None'.
        origin_edge_length (float): Length of the branch connecting the
            origin node to its single child (brosc or root) or to the
            present. If there is a root, this length does not care
            about intervening direct (sampled) ancestor between the
            origin and the root. Will be 0.0 if no origin node.
        root_age (float): Age of root node, if there is one, otherwise
            0.0.
        node_heights_dict (dict): Dictionary that holds the heights of
            all nodes in the tree. Keys are node labels, values are
            floats.
        node_ages_dict (dict): Dictionary that holds the ages of all
            nodes in the tree. Keys are node labels, values are
            floats.
        slice_t_ends (float): List of floats with the end times for
            specified time slices (epochs). If not provided by user
            Upon instantiation of class, will be 'None'.
        slice_age_ends (dict): List of floats with the end ages for
            specified time slices (epochs). If not provided by user
            Upon instantiation of class, will be 'None'.
        state_count (int): How many states there are.
        state_count_dict (dict): Dictionary tabulating how many
            terminal nodes in the full tree are in each state. Keys are
            integers representing states and values are their counts.
        extant_terminal_state_count_dict (dict): Dictionary tabulating
            how many living (terminal) nodes are in each state. Keys
            are integers representing states and values are their
            counts.
        extant_sampled_terminal_state_count_dict (dict): Dictionary
            tabulating how many living (terminal) and sampled nodes are
            in each state. Keys are integers representing states and
            values are their counts.
        extinct_sampled_state_count_dict (dict): Dictionary tabulating
            how many extinct (terminal) nodes are in each state. Keys
            are integers representing states and values are their
            counts.
        sa_node_state_count_dict (dict): Dictionary tabulating
            how many direct (sampled) ancestor nodes are in each state.
            Keys are integers representing states and values are their
            counts.
        node_attr_dict (dict): Nested dictionaries. Keys of the outer
            dictionary are node labels, values are inner dictionaries.
            Inner dictionary's key are attribute names (str) and
            values are the attribute's values (Any).
        n_extant_terminal_nodes (int): Count of living terminal nodes.
        n_extinct_terminal_nodes (int): Count of dead terminal nodes.
        n_extant_sampled_terminal_nodes (int): Count of living and
            sampled terminal nodes.
        n_sa_nodes (int): Count of direct (sampled) ancestors. These
            are nodes that are both sampled and observed by
            definition.
        epsilon (float): Float threshold to determine if a
            tiny decimal number is to be considered 0.0 or not. In
            other words, if the difference between a tiny value 'x'
            and 0.0 is smaller than epsilon, then 'x' is set to 0.0.
            If not provided by user upon initialization of class,
            defaults to 1e-12.
