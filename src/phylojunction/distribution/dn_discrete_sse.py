class DnSSE(pgm.DistrForSampling):
    """Discrete SSE distribution.

    Class for the discrete state-dependent speciation and extinction
    (SSE) distribution. Used for sampling phylogenetic trees annotated
    with discrete states.
    
    The simulate() method in this class is a 'rising tide' sampler,
    where all living lineages grow together. It is not a recursive
    sampler in which lineages take care of growing themselves and recur
    upon birth events.

    At all times we know:
        (i)  how many lineages are alive and dead
        (ii) all the character states represented by living lineages

    Parameters:
        n_sim (int): Number of trees to sample. Defaults to 1.
        n_repl (int): Number of tree replicates per sample. This
            is equivalent to the size of a plate in the DAG
            representation. Defaults to 1.
        with_origin (bool): Flag for whether the process starts at the
            origin or not.
        root_is_born (bool): Attribute that records if root node was
            created and is in tree (for when it starts at the origin).
            'True' if process starts at the root.
        start_states (int): List of integers representing the starting
            states of each of the 'n_sim' samples.
        seed_age (float, optional): Age of seed node (either origin or
            root).
        condition_on_speciation (bool): Flag for rejecting tree samples
            that do not go a single speciation event before 'stop_val'
            is met. Note that this first speciation event may or not be
            what is canonically the reconstructed tree root node. If
            'True', rejects tree sample failing to meet condition.
            Defaults to 'False'.
        condition_on_survival (bool): Flag for rejecting tree samples
            that go extinct before 'stop_val' is met. If 'True',
            rejects tree sample failing to meet condition. Defaults to
            'True'.
        condition_on_obs_both_sides_root (bool): Flag for rejecting
            tree samples that do not have observed nodes on both sides
            of the complete tree's root node. If 'True', rejects tree
            sample failing to meet condition. Defaults to 'False'.
        stop (str): Stop condition to end sampling (simulation)
            procedure and return tree. If 'age', stops when age of
            either origin or is equal to 'stop_val' (see below).
            If "size", stops when tree has 'stop_val' observed nodes.
        stop_val (float): List of values used by 'stop' (see above) to
            end each of the 'n_sim' sampling (simulation) procedures
            and return tree. Either maximum age, or maximum count of
            observable nodes.
        min_rec_taxa (int): Required minimum number of observed taxa in
            reconstructed tree. Defaults to 0.
        max_rec_taxa (int): Required maximum number of observed taxa in
            reconstructed tree. Defaults to 1e12.
        abort_at_alive_count (int): Number of living (not observed!)
            nodes at which point sample is rejected. This parameter is
            used to abort samples whose SSE parameters cause trees to
            grow too large. Defaults to 1e12.
        sse_stash (SSEStash): Object holding all discrete
            state-dependent parameters we need to sample (i.e.,
            simulate). This object holds (i) the number of discrete
            states of the process, (ii) the number of time slices if
            process is time-heterogeneous, (iii) the end age of each
            time slice.
        events (MacroevolEventHandler): Object that computes total
            rate values, and samples SSE events. It is a member of
            sse_stash.
        state_count (int): Number of states of SSE process.
        n_time_slices (int): Number of time slices (epochs).
        slice_t_ends (float, optional): List of floats with time slice
            time ends (forward!).
        prob_handler (DiscreteStateDependentProbabilityHandler): Object
            that takes care of state-dependent taxon sampling across
            time slices.
        epsilon (float, optional): Float threshold to determine if a
            tiny decimal number is to be considered 0.0 or not. In
            other words, if the difference between a tiny value 'x'
            and 0.0 is smaller than epsilon, then 'x' is set to 0.0.
            Defaults to 1e-12.
        runtime_limit (int, optional): Runtime ceiling (in minutes)
            for obtaining the 'n' tree samples. If this limit is met,
            the sampling procedure is aborted. Defaults to 5.
        rng_seed (int, optional): Integer seed for the two random
            number generators used in this class. This seed is only
            ever used by user if bypassing the scripting language
            (otherwise random number generator seeds are handled in
            cmd_parse.py). Defaults to None.
        debug (bool, optional): Flag for whether to print debugging
            messages during sampling procedure.
        info (bool, optional): Flag for whether to print information
            about running sampling procedure.

        living nodes for which .is_sa_lineage == True.
