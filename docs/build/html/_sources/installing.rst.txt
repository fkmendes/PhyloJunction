Installing and configuring PhyloJunction
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

On this page you will find instructions on how to:

    (i) do a standard installation, so that you can use its command-line and graphical user interfaces,

    (ii) do a development installation (in "editable mode") suitable for those who want to interact, customize, or expand PJ's source code, and

    (iii) build |pj| using an integrated development environment (IDE), so you can navigate its code.

.. We will use the `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ and PyCharm_ IDEs.

-----------------------------
Requirements and dependencies
-----------------------------

For the most part, |pj| has been developed and tested on an M1-chip Apple machine (running macOS Sonoma), though it is periodically tested on Linux (Ubuntu).
There is no support for Microsoft Windows.

|pj| currently runs under Python 3.11 and has various Python library dependencies.
Fortunately those are automatically handled by the `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/>`_ installer, as shown below.

-------------------------
Typical user installation
-------------------------

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Unix operating systems
+++++++++++++++++++++++

|pj| is hosted in the Python package index (PyPI; `here <https://pypi.org/project/PhyloJunction/>`_), and can be automatically installed with the ``pip`` tool.
With ``pip`` installed, all that needs to be done is running the following command on the Terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3.11 -m pip install phylojunction

``pip`` will take care of installing all of |pj|'s dependencies, and will proceed to place |pj|'s entry-point executables (`pjcli` and `pjgui`) and the library's source files inside appropriate directories.

If you are running an Apple operating system and installed Python with `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_, ``pip`` will place the entry points in ``/opt/homebrew/bin`` and the source files in ``/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/phylojunction``.

If you are running a Debian Linux distribution, ``pip`` will normally place the entry points in ``/usr/local/bin`` if you have superuser access, and if not, in ``~/.local/bin``.
Source files, in turn, are placed in ``/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/`` with superuser access, and in ``~/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/`` without.

------------------------
Development installation
------------------------

On both macOS and Linux, we will start by cloning the |pj| `GitHub repository <https://github.com/fkmendes/PhyloJunction>`_.
Open your Terminal, go to a directory of choice, and do:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/fkmendes/PhyloJunction.git

You will see that ``git`` will have created the |pj| root folder, ``PhyloJunction/``, inside the directory you chose.

Installation in editable mode
=============================

In this section you will find instructions on how to install |pj| in **editable mode** (some might know this as setuptools' "develop mode"), on both macOS and Linux.

When a library being installed is being locally developed, this type of installation is convenient for a few reasons.
First, an editable install will not copy all of the library's source files and then place them somewhere as part of the installation.
Instead, it will only install dependencies and write metadata and wrapper files for library entry points (``pjcli`` and ``pjgui`` in |pj|'s case').

Second, without the need for re-installation, changes to the library's source files are effective immediately when the library is next imported, or when entry points are called.
This is because the environment ``PYTHONPATH`` variable will always point to the latest version of the library's source files (see below).

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Apple operating systems
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The editable install is carried out from |pj|'s root folder, ``PhyloJunction/``, like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3.11 -m pip install -e .

With this command, ``pip`` will place |pj|'s entry-point executables (``pjcli`` and ``pjgui``) into the ``bin/`` directory of wherever you Python 3.11 lives.
If Python 3.11 was installed with `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_, for example, that could be ``/opt/homebrew/bin``.
Other package information files would then be placed in ``/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/PhyloJunction-X.Y.Z.dist-info``.

The ``-e`` flag tells ``pip`` to do an editable install, which further writes the path to |pj| modules to, for example, ``/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages/__editable__.PhyloJunction-X.Y.Z.pth``.
The last argument ``.`` tells ``pip`` where the local project directory is (where it can find file ``setup.py``).

If file system access is denied, you can add the ``--user`` flag to the installation command, like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3.11 -m pip install --user -e .

Here, ``pip`` will put the executables in a different, standard location, ``/Users/user_name/Library/Python/3.11/bin/``.
Other package information files, in turn, can be found in ``/Users/user_name/Library/Python/3.11/lib/python/site-packages/PhyloJunction-X.Y.Z.dist-info``
Paths to |pj|'s modules will be written to ``/Users/user_name/Library/Python/3.11/lib/python/site-packages/__editable__.phylojunction-X.Y.Z.pth``
(Note that above, ``user_name`` will be whichever **your** user name is.)

A third option that works as an alternative to using the ``--user`` flag is to run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3.11 -m pip install --prefix ~/.local -e .

This option works well for those who like to keep software binaries (or symbolic links to them) all in the hidden directory ``~/.local/bin``.
This command will create ``bin/`` inside ``~/.local`` if it does not exist, and place |pj|'s executables in there.
Lastly, package information files and paths to |pj|'s modules will be written to ``~/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/`` and directories therein.

.. note::
   After running these commands, do not forget to tell your operating system where to look for |pj|'s executables, ``pjcli`` and ``pjgui``.
   For example, assuming you installed |pj| with the ``--user`` flag, you can then add path ``/Users/user_name/Library/Python/3.11/bin/`` to your environment ``PATH`` variable.
   Alternatively, if installation was carried out with ``--prefix ~/.local``, add that path instead.

   Additionally, you will have to tell your operating system where to find |pj|'s source files, which must be done via the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable.
   The source files will be in the directory |pj| was cloned to, specifically ``PhyloJunction/src``.

   The ``PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` variables are normally defined in a hidden file in your root directory that gets executed by the Terminal app.
   On macOS, that file is ``~/.bash_profile`` (depending on your setup, you could also use ``~/.bashrc``).
   
   In order to update the ``PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` environmental variables, open ``~/.bash_profile`` with a text editor and add the following path to it:

   .. code-block:: bash
        
        PATH=$PATH:/Users/user_name/Library/Python/3.11/bin
        export PATH

        PYTHONPATH=/path_to/PhyloJunction/src
        export PYTHONPATH

   Should you still want to use your current, active Terminal session, you must source ``~/.bash_profile`` after saving and closing that file.
   
   .. code-block:: bash

        source ~/.bash_profile

+++++
Linux
+++++

Carrying out an editable install on a (Debian) Linux machine is not much different from what is described above for Apple operating systems.
If you have system access, you can run the following command from |pj|'s root folder, ``PhyloJunction/``:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo python3.11 -m pip install -e .

This command will first place |pj|'s entry-point executables (``pjcli`` and ``pjgui``) into ``/usr/local/bin``.
Similarly to Apple operating systems, paths to |pj|'s source files are then written to ``/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/PhyloJunction.egg-link``.
That is it.

If you do not have system access, the second route is to try:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3.11 -m pip install --prefix ~/.local -e .

The above command will place ``pjcli`` and ``pjgui`` into ``~/.local/bin`` and ``PhyloJunction.egg-link`` into ``~/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/``.

Finally, in order to execute |pj| it is necessary to update the ``PATH`` and ``PYTHONPATH`` variables with the paths to |pj|'s points of entry and source files (see note in previous section).

------------------------
Testing the installation
------------------------

If installation was successful (see the Note box above), it should be possible to call |pj|'s graphical (:ref:`GUI <GUI>`) and command-line user interfaces (:ref:`CLI <CLI>`) directly from the Terminal or shell:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: **Executing PhyloJunction from the Terminal or shell**. If the entry points (pjcli and pjgui) cannot be found, make sure you have set your PATH environmental variable correctly.

    pjcli # CLI
    pjgui # GUI

Alternatively, users can import all of |pj|'s modules within a Python session.
First call Python's interpreter, and then:

.. code-block:: python

    import phylojunction

Lastly, users can bypass the standalone user interfaces via a "sandbox" script (``pj_sandbox.py``) that can be found :ref:`here <bypass>`.
After replacing ``[path]`` (below) with whatever the path is to the ``PhyloJunction/`` directory, running the sandbox script can be done like so from the Terminal or shell:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: **Executing PhyloJunction's sandbox script from the Terminal or shell**. Different examples can be found inside pj_sandbox.py, and can be turned on or off by modifying that script.
    
    python3.11 /[path]/PhyloJunction/src/phylojunction/interface/pj_sandbox.py

---------------------
Building PJ on an IDE 
---------------------

Researchers who want to navigate or expand |pj|'s code base may want to build the library using an integrated development environment (IDE).
One IDE that continues to be supported on multiple operating systems is JetBrains' `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ (Visual Studio Code for Mac will be retired in August 2024).

Assuming the user has a fresh install of PyCharm, the first thing to do is to open the IDE and set up a Python interpreter.
This can be done by clicking "<No interpreter>" in the bottom-right corner, and then doing "Add New Interpreter" > "Add Local Interpreter" > "System Interpreter" (left menu) > Interpreter: [path to Python 3 binary].

    **Figure 1.** The PhyloJunction project after being built with PyCharm.

Then all that needs to be done is to click "File" (top-left menu) > "Open...", and then select the root of |pj| GitHub's repository (``PhyloJunction/``; see Fig. 1).
If building is successful, it should be possible to double-click ``pj_sandbox.py`` (inside ``src/phylojunction/interface``), select "Current file" from the top-right menu next to the green arrow icon, and then run the script (by clicking the green arrow).
